<li>constructed or substantially renovated your own home or hired someone else to construct or substantially renovate your home for use as your (or your relation’s) primary place of residence, if the fair market value of the house when the construction is substantially completed is less than $450,000</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an individual who purchased a new or substantially renovated <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#mobile</a> (including a modular home) or a new or substantially renovated <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#floating">floating home</a> for use as your (or your relation’s) primary place of residence, you may be eligible for a new housing rebate for some of the GST/HST paid. In addition, for the purpose of claiming the GST/HST new housing rebate, you may have the option to treat the home as being purchased from a builder or as being an owner-built house.</p>
<p>Proposed legislation was tabled in the House of Commons on June 5, 2025, to introduce a first-time home buyers’ (FTHB) GST/HST rebate. If the proposed legislation is enacted, as a first-time home buyer you may be eligible for the first-time home buyers’ GST/HST rebate, in addition to the GST/HST new housing rebate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FTHB GST/HST rebate, with the existing GST/HST new housing rebate (where that rebate is applicable), would provide a rebate of 100% of the GST or the federal part of the HST on new homes valued up to $1 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FTHB GST/HST rebate would be gradually reduced for new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million. For example, under the linear phase-out, a home valued at $1.25 million (i.e., the mid-point between $1 million and $1.5 million) would be eligible for a rebate of up to $25,000 (50% of the maximum rebate of $50,000). No FTHB GST/HST Rebate would be available for new homes valued at or above $1.5 million.</p>

        <p>The information below is based on proposed legislation introduced in the House of Commons on June 5, 2025. The FTHB GST/HST rebate is currently subject to parliamentary approval and may change. The CRA is following standard practice when issuing rebates and will not process claims for the FTHB GST/HST rebate until the required legislation has received Royal Assent.</p>
<p>You may be eligible to claim the FTHB GST/HST rebate if&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>You meet the eligibility criteria for the GST/HST new housing rebate listed above, or generally, you would meet &nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;the eligibility criteria if the maximum purchase price or fair market value of the house was changed to $1.5 million (see <a href="#purchase">Houses purchased from a builder</a>&nbsp;and <a href="#built">Owner-built houses</a> sections above)</li>
<li>You entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with a builder for a new or substantially renovated house on or after May 27, 2025, and before 2031, and ownership of the house is transferred to you before 2036. You must also intend, at that time, to use the house as your primary place of residence.</li>
<li>Construction of the house begins before 2031 and the house is substantially completed before 2036</li>
<li>In the case of an owner-built home, the construction or substantial renovation begins on or after May 27, 2025 and before 2031, and for use as your primary place of residence.</li>
<li>You are a&nbsp;<strong>first-time home buyer</strong> who is the first to occupy the home</li>
<li>You have&nbsp;<strong>neither</strong>&nbsp;received nor have been deemed to have received the first-time home buyers GST rebate previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, to be considered a <strong>first-time home buyer</strong>,&nbsp;you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be at least 18 years of age</li>
<li>be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada</li>
<li><strong>not</strong>&nbsp;have lived in a home, whether inside or outside of Canada, that you or your spouse or common-law partner owned or jointly owned as your primary place of residence at any time in the calendar year or in the preceding four calendar years</li>
</ul>
